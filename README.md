# LinkQueue

Opening too many tabs can slow your computer down considerably.
With this extension, you can save any link to a running list you can view when clicking the toolbar button.

Ways to save links:

- Clickthe toolbar button to show the main popup. There's a button to save current tab's URL
- Right click on a link and select "Save Link to Queue" in context menu.
- X.com/Twitter has special save button added to the top right of every tweet.

Other functions:

- LinkQueue keeps track of each url you click on from the popup menu by crossing it out.
- Export all links currently in the popup menu as a json object
- Clear all links in popup with "remove all" button
- Remove individual link by pressing on red x to right of link

Works on Safari for Mac, but not in iOS
